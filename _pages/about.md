Dr. Guo-Sen Xie is currently a Professor at Nanjing University of Science and Technology (NJUST). He received his Ph.D. degree in Pattern Recognition and Intelligent System from Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA) under the supervision of [Prof. Cheng-Lin Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8r3y8IMAAAAJ&hl=en), in 2016. From 2020 to 2022, he was a researcher at Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence. From 2018 to 2020, he was a research scientist at Inception Institute of Artificial Intelligence. He was a visiting research student at National University of Singapore (NUS) from 2014 to 2015, supervised by [Prof. Shuicheng Yan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DNuiPHwAAAAJ&hl=en). He has authored/co-authored over 40 papers in top conferences/journals such as IEEE TPAMI, IJCV, CVPR, ICCV, and ECCV.

His current research interests mainly focus on computer vision, pattern recognition, and deep learning. Recently, he has been focusing on the challenging problem of understanding complex visual data, such as cross-category, zero-/few-shot, and low-annotated data, driven by knowledge-based approaches.
